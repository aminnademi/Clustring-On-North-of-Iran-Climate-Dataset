# Clustering with PCA

This project demonstrates clustering analysis on a Iranian dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The dataset includes features `tp` (total precipitation) and `t2m` (temperature). The steps involve preprocessing, visualization, PCA, and clustering.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Selected relevant features (`tp`, `t2m`).
   - Handled missing values (if present).
   - Standardized features for clustering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distributions of the features.
   - Created scatter plots to observe patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality while retaining 95% of the variance.

4. **Clustering**
   - Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Applied K-Means clustering.
   - Calculated silhouette score to evaluate cluster quality.

5. **Visualization**
   - Plotted clusters on PCA-reduced dimensions.


## Output

- PCA-reduced scatter plots with clusters.
- Elbow method graph for selecting optimal clusters.
- Silhouette score for clustering evaluation.
